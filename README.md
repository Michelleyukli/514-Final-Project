# Ultimate Frisbee Tracker
It's a wearable ultimate Frisbee data recording device to facilitate frisbee players to monitor their Frisbee data during competition and training. The sensing device will incorporate a small, lightweight enclosure that can be easily attached to the frisbee players. Considering the dynamic nature of Ultimate Frisbee, a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection will ensure real-time data transfer without impacting the player's performance. The display device, designed for player convenience, will feature a wrist-mounted or clothing-attachable enclosure with intuitive controls.
